The aim of our research is to explore how people's thoughts and emotions develop in everyday life. We are also interested in finding out how people think about events happening in the world around them. Participation in the study is completely voluntary. You may opt out of the study at any time without justification, or refuse to answer the questions.



In the first section of the study, we ask you to fill out questionnaires about the extent to which certain statements apply to you in general, which will take about 10 minutes. We will then ask you to use a mobile application to evaluate your current emotions and thoughts about events in your environment four times a day for a maximum of 3 days via short surveys. The first short questionnaire you complete on each day will be about 3 minutes long, and the remaining short questionnaires for a day will take about 1 minute to complete. We kindly ask you to respond to the prompts as often as possible, given the circumstances are appropriate, and to leave feedback at the end of every short survey that will help us discover technical issues and improve the participant experience.



We appreciate the time and effort you put into taking part in our study. You will be paid £15.00 per hour for completing the initial questionnaires and the short daily surveys. Your final compensation amount will be determined by the number of short surveys you fill during the 3 days. In total, you can earn up to £5.50 by taking part.



We will later perform statistical analyses on the data obtained in the study, which will not allow for the identification of individual participants due to anonymization. The data will be downloaded to a password-protected computer and an external hard drive. It will then be deleted from applications used for data collection. After data processing, we will publish the databases and codes related to analyses (github.org, osf.io). No individual medical report or feedback summary will be prepared based on the data obtained, other than the one automatically generated by the app used for the daily surveys.



By proceeding, you consent to the use of data collected about you during the study for research purposes and to make it available to other researchers.
